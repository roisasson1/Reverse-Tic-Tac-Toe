# Reverse Tic-Tac-Toe Windows Application

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, implemented in **C# using .NET as a Windows application**. The primary objective of the game is to force the opponent to create a sequence of their symbols, which results in their loss. The project emphasizes object-oriented programming (OOP), the use of external DLLs, working with classes (including access modifiers, constructors, and properties), and the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to create a challenging opponent.

## Features

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Class Design**: The project utilizes multiple classes to separate concerns and ensure a modular design. Classes are used to manage the game logic, user interface, and AI opponent.
- **Access Modifiers and Properties**: Proper use of access modifiers (public, private, protected) and properties ensures encapsulation and data integrity.
- **Constructors**: Custom constructors initialize game components, setting up the game board, players, and other necessary elements.

### Features

- **Artificial Intelligence**: The AI opponent is designed to read the player's moves and respond strategically, rather than acting randomly. This provides a challenging and engaging gameplay experience.
- **Event Handling**: Events are used to communicate changes between the game logic and the UI. For example, when a cell on the game board changes, an event is triggered to update the corresponding UI element.
- **Windows Forms**: The project is developed as a Windows application using Windows Forms. This involves designing forms and using various controls to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
